# Purpose
The ultimate goal is simple - be most advanced support tool for Dwarf Fortress.

Current goals are to perform various types of static analysis, answering questions of these types:

* Who has best potentional for being a Miner?
* What dwarf will achieve legendary status in Miner fastest?
* What labours should I assign to what dwarves if I want 2 Miners, 1 broker and 1 gemcutter?


# Technical notes
The tool uses definition of various dwarven thingies taken from Memory.xml of DFHack.

[JetBrains MPS](www.jetbrains.com/mps/) used to define DSL. Lots of developmnent is done using it.


# Build instructions
